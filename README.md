# Astro JS Image Optimization Demo

This is a demonstration of the built-in `<Image>` component of the Astro JS framework. Clone this repository and run `yarn install` to install the dependencies. Then run `yarn start` to start the demo.

The main `<Image>` component is located at `src/components/Image.astro`. It's imported in the `src/pages/index.astro` file. Two images are also available for testing in the `src/images` directory.
